# ultrasonic sensor distance calculator

In this project we have 11 ultrasonic sensors.

I used second arduino pin for common trigger pin for all sensor  and 3-13 as a sensor echo pins.

Group 1 pin selection for voltage outputs: 14-23

Group 2 pin selection for voltage outputs: 24-33

Group 3 pin selection for voltage outputs: 34-43

Ultrasonic sensor have maximum 400 cm range.I convert to metre.So when distance is 4m there is maximum output.


And here i tested code using leds: https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/320301757666165332
